      <p>In this type of climbing, the climber is also wearing a harness, but they tie a rope on their harness while
        still on the ground.
        This rope is connected to an anchor, or a bar, at the top of the route they want to climb.

    <p>
      For all of these kinds of climbing, you'll want a good pair of shoes and chalk (normally carried in a chalk bag).
      You don't need a harness for bouldering, but you'll <strong>probably</strong> want one for the other kinds of
      climbing. <em>Well, at least if you don't like injuries or death.</em>
